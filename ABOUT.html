                <p>Once upon a time, in the year 2003, I was born.From a young age, I showed a passion for both baking and programming. <br> I loved to spend time in the kitchen with my mother,learning how to bake delicious treats. <br> I also loved to play on the computer, writing code and creating new games. <br>I love spending time alone, where I can focus on my baking and programming. <br> I also love to watch my favorite series, which help me to relax and unwind. <br>I am a programmer by day and baker by night. I love the challenge of solving complex programming problems, but I also find great satisfaction in creating delicious cakes. <br> My baking is inspired by my love of programming. <br> I love the creativity and problem-solving involved in both baking and programming</p>
